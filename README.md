## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `Math`: This directory contains solutions for basic math problems. Topics covered include arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and more. 🧮
- `DSA`: This directory contains solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms questions. Topics covered include arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more. 🛠️

Each directory contains subdirectories for specific topics, and each subdirectory contains one or more solution files. The solution files are named according to the problem they solve, and they include a brief description of the problem, the solution, and any relevant comments or explanations. 📖


Happy coding!
